2. Permutation groups
=====================

The first symmetries we will describe are permutations acting on a finite set $X$.
Because $X$ is finite, we can assume that $X = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. We write $S_n$ the set of all possible permutations of elements in the set. These permutations form a group:

* The identity permutation sends $1$ to $1$, $2$ to $2$, ... and $n$ to $n$.
* Permutations compose, and this composition is associative.
* The inverse permutation exists.

Here are the available topics on permutation groups on this subject:
