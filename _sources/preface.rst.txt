Preface
=======

This text is intended as an introduction to the RepLAB library.
It provides a mathematical and computational introduction to the topics handled by the software.
The writing style is pretty informal, and we will redirect the reader to algebra textbooks when necessary.

The RepLAB Handbook is currently much of a work-in-progress; we encourage readers to dig into the `API documentation <https://replab.github.io/api>`_ as well, as it is more complete.
Anyhow, we wish you as much pleasure discovering the abilities of this library as we had writing it.
