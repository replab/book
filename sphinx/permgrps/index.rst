2. Permutation groups
=====================

The permutations of a finite set $X$ are the first symmetries we will describe.
Because $X$ is finite, we can assume $X = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, and we write $S_n$ the set of all its permutations, and they form a group:

* The identity permutation sends $1$ to $1$, $2$ to $2$, ... and $n$ to $n$.
* Permutations compose, and this composition is associative.
* The inverse permutation exists.
