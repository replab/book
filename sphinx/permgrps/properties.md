# 2.3 Computing group properties

RepLAB helps us investigate the properties of groups. Let us see a few of those.

We will work with the symmetric group of degree $4$, the alternating group of degree $4$, and the cyclic group of order 4.

```{code-cell}
S4 = replab.PermutationGroup.symmetric(4)
A4 = replab.PermutationGroup.alternating(4)
C4 = replab.PermutationGroup.cyclic(4)
```

## Group order

We can readily compute the order of a group.

```{code-cell}
S4.order
```

And RepLAB can compute group orders that do not fit in a standard MATLAB/Octave number, so
all orders returned are of type `vpi`.

```{code-cell}
S100 = replab.S(100);
S100_order = S100.order
S100_order_class = class(S100.order)
```

Of course, when you work only with smaller groups, you can always convert the order back into
a standard number type.

```{code-cell}
double(S4.order)
```

Do not do that if the order is bigger than $2^53$! Otherwise the result cannot be stored in a
`double` exactly in general

```{code-cell}
double(S100.order) % beware
```

## Commutativity

The [center](https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Center) of a group is the set $Z(G)$ of all elements of the group that commute with every element of $G$.

```{code-cell}
A4.center
```

An [abelian](https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Abelian_group) or commutative group has all its elements commute, and is equal to its center.

```{code-cell}
C4_commutative = C4.isCommutative
C4 == C4.center
A4_commutative = A4.isCommutative
A4 == A4.center
```

If a group can be  generated by a single element, it is cyclic.

```{code-cell}
C4_cyclic = C4.isCyclic
A4_cyclic = A4.isCyclic
```

## Simple groups

A [simple group](https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Simple_group) is a group that does not have a normal subgroup:

```{code-cell}
S4_simple = S4.isSimple
A4_simple = A4.isSimple
C4_simple = C4.isSimple
```

## Group exponent

The group [exponent](https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Exponent_of_a_group) is the smallest positive integer $e$ such that $g^e = g \cdot g \cdots g = \operatorname{id}$.

```{code-cell}
S4_exponent = S4.exponent
A4_exponent = A4.exponent
C4_exponent = C4.exponent
```
